## Papers overview

### COT
Chain of thought prompting increases models answers quality. That is true for solving simple math problems.
Authors outline that the larger model is the better COT will work.

authors say that COT will work if
1) the task is challenging and requires 18 multi-step reasoning
2) a large language model is used
3) the scaling curve is relatively flat


Standart Prompt:
Q: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does he have now? 
A: The answer is 11.

COT prompt:
Q: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does he have now? 
A: Roger started with 5 balls. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each is 6 tennis balls. 5 + 6 = 11. The answer is 11.

### Exploring Chain-of-Thought Style Prompting for Text-to-SQL

1) Chain of thought 
reasoning through the output
2) Least to most
First apply the reduction of the task, second solve the reducted task and the initial 

Ex. Show first name, last name, age for all female students. Their sex is F. -> 
reduction. Show first name, last name, age for all female students
solution. Their sex is F.

Looks like reasoning but more guided.

3) Question Decomposition Prompting

Proposed method of decomposition via COT. 

4) QDP + InterCOL
Additional information with columns and rows names

### Can LLM Already Serve as A Database Interface?

Containing 12,751 pairs of text-to-SQL data and 95 databases with a total size of 33.4 GB. 

Feels like validated extra data.  ![Comparison](text2sql_data_comparison.png)

#### Metrics:

1) Accuracy
2) Valid Efficiency Score = $\sum \cfrac{I\{\text{valid} \} R(V,\hat{V})}{N} \quad R = \sqrt{\cfrac{E(V)}{E(\hat{V})}}$
E - measure of efficency, ex. running time. 


#### Ideas
could be used in prompting
"First, our database experts create a description file explaining all column names, abbreviated values, value types, and external knowledge for each database to help annotators better understand the database contents."
